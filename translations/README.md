# Translations
 This is the translations directory! Used for all the module translations.

# Structure
 The [init.lua file](translations/init.lua) is used to set up `translations` and `global_translations` tables.<br>
 Each directory here has the name of the mode where it is used, with the exception of the [global one](translations/global) which is used everywhere in the module.
